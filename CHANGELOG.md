## 0.2.1

Fix bug where the underlying [PDFbox](https://github.com/TomRoush/PdfBox-Android) plugin would break if downloading multiple PDF-files with the same name and then attempting to open one of them.

This should allow users to catch the exception and inform the user that something went wrong.
